## Description

This is a MySQL database that uses Sequelize to categorize a list of items on a hypothetical e-commerce site. Users can add, delete, or change the items, their categories, and their tags. The database keeps track of the relationships between these three, and will update accordingly to user input.

## Installation

You need MySQL and an API client such as Insomnia. Clone the repository, install the required packages, then open MySQL and run the schema. Run the seeds in your terminal, then start your server. You should then be able to run CRUD operations through your client.

## Usage

Once you have everything running, simply use http://localhost:3005/api/ followed by whichever endpoint you want to modify (i.e. /categories/, /products/, /tags/). Select your chosen CRUD operation, then change your JSON body accordingly.

## Demonstration

The following series of videos will show you how to use different operations.
